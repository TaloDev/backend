            You are reviewing PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in the repository ${{ github.repository }}.

            Review this pull request and provide feedback focused only on improvements needed (not what works well):

            **Categories to check:**
            1. Code quality and best practices
            2. Potential bugs or issues
            3. Performance considerations
            4. Security concerns
            5. Test coverage

            **Process:**
            - The PR number is: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            - View the PR using: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }}`
            - Read CLAUDE.md to understand best practices
            - View the PR diff using: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }}`
            - If an issue spans multiple categories, list it only once in the most relevant section
            - Prioritize by severity: 🔴 Critical → 🟡 Major → 🔵 Minor
            - Focus only on changes introduced in this PR, not pre-existing code issues

            **Review Workflow (Follow these steps):**
            1. **Analysis Phase**: Review the PR diff and identify potential issues
            2. **Validation Phase**: For each issue you find, verify it by:
               - Re-reading the relevant code carefully
               - Checking if your suggested fix is actually different from the current code
               - Checking if existing tests demonstrate the code handles this case
               - Confirming the issue violates documented standards (check CLAUDE.md)
               - Ensuring your criticism is actionable and specific
            3. **Draft Phase**: Write your review only after validating all issues
            4. **Quality Check**: Before posting, remove any issues where:
               - Your "before" and "after" code snippets are identical
               - You're uncertain or use phrases like "appears", "might", "should verify"
               - The issue is theoretical without clear impact
            5. **Post Phase**: Only post the review if you have concrete, validated feedback

            **Edge Case Policy:**
            Only flag edge cases that meet ALL of these criteria:
            1. Realistic: Could happen in normal usage or common error scenarios
            2. Impactful: Would cause bugs, security issues, or data problems (not just "it's not perfect")
            3. Actionable: Can be fixed with reasonable effort in this PR's scope

            Ignore theoretical issues that require multiple unlikely conditions or malicious input patterns.
            Use the "would this bother a pragmatic senior developer?" test.

            Maximum chain of assumptions: 2 levels deep. Skip exotic input combinations that violate documented assumptions.

            **Feedback style:**
            - Provide specific code examples or line references showing the issue
            - Suggest concrete fixes with code snippets where helpful
            - Keep total feedback under 500 words
            - Use section headers with emojis and horizontal dividers (---)
            - If no improvements needed in a category, simply state "No issues found"
            - Use neutral language; focus on the code, not the author
            - If the PR looks good overall, say so clearly rather than forcing criticism

            **Comment Management (IMPORTANT):**
            Post your review using this command, which will edit your last comment if one exists, or create a new one:
            ```bash
              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --edit-last --create-if-none --body "<review>"
            ```

            Ensure proper escaping of quotes and special characters in the comment body. Use single quotes around the body and escape any single quotes inside with '\''
